# About Me

Dr. Theresa Windus is a Distinguished Professor in the Chemistry Department at Iowa State University and
a Senior Scientist at Ames National Laboratory. She was the project lead for the 
[NWChemEx](https://github.com/NWChemEx/NWChemEx) project, and she is the Deputy Director for the Molecular Sciences
Software Institute [MolSSI](https://molssi.org/). Theresa's research interests include 
using new models (including machine learning) to understand and predict chemical processes, 
high-performance quantum chemistry, and heavy element chemistry.

# Why I Like My Research

Computational chemistry lets me learn about chemistry without getting into the lab - where I am a
disaster. However, since I love understanding why chemistry works, combining chemistry with computers and math is the
perfect place for me! I also love mentoring students and helping them learn to think critically about research. So,
being a mentor in the SIMCODES project is truly exciting!

# Success in My Group

Ultimately, success in my group is measured by the effort one puts into learning
and, hopefully(!), in new science that leads to publications. In the SIMCODES project,
we are especially interested in working with early career undergraduate students who
may not have any or much research experience. So, understanding the basics of how research
projects work is also a goal for the project.

# Example Research Projects

Some of the research projects REU students can work on with me include:

## Enzyme Screening using Machine Learning Models

An important aspect of enzyme design is assessing potential candidates. One
way to do this is through high-throughput screening which relies on computing QM (Quantum Mechanics)/
MM (Molecular Mechanics)-based properties of each potential candidate. We will first
generate MM and QM/MM properties for a series of enzymes and then train an ML model
to reproduce the properties. As part of this training, we will focus on reaction pathway optimizations
to gain information on the kinetics of the enzymatic processes. Reaction pathway
optimization is a notoriously difficult problem, particularly for chemical systems with many
degrees of freedom. The situation becomes even more complicated when one factors in reaction
conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH). This project will generate dynamics data
for a series of enzyme reactions, under a series of reaction conditions. Next, an ML model
will be trained to reproduce the simulations. Additional research directions, include predicting
how the properties will map to reactivity, or using ML to predict a more meaningful set of
properties. Modifications on existing enzymes will be used to test the predictive capabilities
of the ML models.
