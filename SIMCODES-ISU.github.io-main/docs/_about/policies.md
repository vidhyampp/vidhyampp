This page contains formal write ups of the policies and procedures used
throughout the SIMCODES program and applies to all activities whether they are
online or offline.

# Code of Conduct

> SIMCODES is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, color, creed, disability, gender identity, genetic
information, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, protected U.S. veteran status, or other protected class. We do not
tolerate harassment of summer school participants, staff, or faculty in any
form. Any participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the REU program at the discretion of the organizers. We expect participants to
follow these rules at all SIMCODES talks/research/activities and event-
related social activities. SIMCODES is also bound by Iowa State University
[policies](https://www.policy.iastate.edu/policy/discrimination, 2) on
discrimination and harassment. All participants are expected to
follow these policies for conduct and reporting of violations of the code of
conduct.

# Mentor Selection

In the interest of transparency guidelines for the mentor/mentee-pairing of the 
SIMCODES REU are documented here.

For these first several steps, once a mentor and mentee have been matched they 
are removed from further consideration. This ensures that all potential mentors 
have the opportunity to match with at least one mentee before doubling (or 
tripling) up. In order of priority the first set of matches are made by:

1. Mutual top choice matches (i.e., both mentor and student rank each other as 
   their top-choice).
2. Mutual match where mentor places the student as their first choice and the
   student places the mentor as their second or third choice.
3. Mutual matches where mentor places the student as their second choice and the
   student ranks the mentor as their first, second, or third choice.
4. Mutual matches where mentor places the student as their third choice and the
   student ranks the mentor as their first, second, or third choice.
5. Mentor's choice (assuming student agrees; if student does not agree then
   mentor picks again).

At this point each mentor has been given the chance to select the student they 
want. If a mentor still has no student they are removed from consideration.
Each remaining mentor may then take one additional student by repeating steps
2 through 5. Mentors without two students at the end of this iteration are
removed from the further consideration. The process then repeats with each
remaining mentor being allowed to take a third student, again following steps
2 through 5. Should more students remain the process can continue iteratively.

It is important to note that this is a guideline and not strictly adhered to.
In practice every application and project is somewhat unique, and the uniqueness
of the application/project often warrant special considerations that do not
neatly fall into the above policy.

Ultimately the goal of the SIMCODES REU is to ensure students have an
enlightening and productive (and hopefully fun) experience!!!

# Data Policies

This is an abridged format of the Data Management Plan.

## Products of Research
Data created by the SIMCODES project is categorized as one of the following:

- **Training materials**. This including slide presentations, code templates, 
  code examples, and video recordings of boot camp tutorials. 
- **Numerical data**. Project-specific. Examples include output logs from 
  software packages, databases of numerical results, molecular dynamics 
  simulations, model training data from machine learning efforts, and data 
  obtained from analyzing primary data.
- **Software**. This includes *new* software units (e.g., libraries or modules), 
  data analysis scripts, and machine learning pipelines 
- **Software contributions**. Software development activities, e.g.,  bug fixes, 
  performance improvements, and potentially new features. Target is existing
  software packages. 
- **Poster**. Students will create a poster at the end of the program to
  showcase their work. 
- **Website**. The source code for the SIMCODES website. 

## Access to Data
SIMCODES@ISU is a public GitHub organization with content licensed under the
open source Apache 2.0 License. *Software* and *numerical results* created as 
part of the SIMCODES center will be made publicly available through the SIMCODES 
organization. Each mentor will be expected to create and maintain repositories, 
which belong to the SIMCODES organization, for each project which results in 
*software* and *numerical results*. At the discretion of the mentor, the public 
release of a project repository may be embargoed until after the results are 
published. Each mentor will be responsible for deciding on their repository's 
license and contribution guidelines, but will be encouraged to adopt the same or
similar policies as the overall organization. As appropriate we will use the 
MolSSI DOI generation capabilities to provide DOIs for numerical results.

*Software contributions* will be made subject to the licensing, contributing, 
and distribution guidelines of the target software package. Contributions will 
only be made to software packages which can guarantee that the contributions 
will eventually be publicly accessible. 

## Policies for Reuse, Redistribution, and Production of Derivatives

*Training materials*, *posters*, and the *website* will be released under the 
terms of the Apache 2.0 License which does not restrict how licensed content 
can be reused, redistributed, or incorporated into derived works, so long as the
original authors are credited. Policies for *software* and *numerical results* 
will be defined per project repository. Generally speaking we expect such 
repositories to be released under the Apache 2.0 License, or another similar 
license, but realize that their may be extraneous circumstances. 
*Software contributions* will be released under the terms of the software 
project to which the contributions are made. 

## Archiving of Data

With the exception of some *software contributions*, all research products will 
be uploaded to the SIMCODES@ISU GitHub organization. At present GitHub maintains
backups of organizations and repositories indefinitely and we will rely on
GitHub for backing up all research.
